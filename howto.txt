This is a document describing what I have learned about the use of Git/Github thus far:

[git config --global] was used to set email, username, etc.
[git add <filename>] adds or stages the file (ready for commit operation)
[git commit -m "my message"] used to commit changes with a commit msg. This means it is still only commited to the local copy
[git push] pushes the local working copy to the remote repository.
[git pull origin master] pulls the diffs from the remote repository into the local working copy

Next: create the remote repository using command line and ssh...
